## Data Transformation
The project includes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts to clean and prepare the AdventureWorks data. These scripts handle tasks such as:

-Transforming data types

-Creating calculated columns and measures

-Visualizing

## Data Modeling
Effective data modeling is crucial for meaningful analysis. This project demonstrates

-Creating relationships between tables

-Defining calculated columns and measures
  - Monthly Growth Rate
  - Total Amount
  - Yearly Growth Rate
    
-Implementing data hierarchies

## Visualizations and Reports
The core of this project is the interactive dashboards and reports created in Power BI. Key visualizations include:

-**Analysis of Account Types**: Analysis total amount according to the account types.

-**Organizational Analysis**: Insights into customer profiles and purchasing behavior.

-**Yearly Growth Rate**
